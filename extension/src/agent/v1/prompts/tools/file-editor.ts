		### Key Principles when using file_editor tool:
		Always gather all changes first, then apply them in one comprehensive transaction, you want to minimize the number of file writes to avoid conflicts and ensure consistency.
		Always before calling file_editor tool, spend time reasoning about your changes inside <thinking></thinking> tags this is mandatory to ensure you have a clear plan and you have thought about all the changes you want to make.
		### Key Principles for each mode
		#### Key Principles for 'whole_write' mode:
		Always provide the full content of the file to be created or rewritten in the kodu_content parameter.
		Never omit any part of the content, always provide the full content.
		Never use placeholders or incomplete code, always provide the full content.
		#### Key Principles for 'edit' mode:
		Always provide the full required updates in the kodu_diff parameter, you should write as many necessary SEARCH/REPLACE blocks in one transaction, you should understand your previous changes and the new changes you want to make and make sure it progresses the file content in the right direction to complete the user task.
		kodu_diff SEARCH and REPLACE must follow a strict FORMAT OF SEARCH\nexact match letter by letter, line by line of the desired content to replace\n=======\nREPLACE\nexact match letter by letter, line by line of the new content\n, this is mandatory to ensure the tool can make the correct changes to the file content.
		You must first identify the exact lines and their content that you want to replace for every change you want to make (every block).
		You must provide at least 3 lines of context before and after your search block to ensure a robust match (this provides the tool with enough context to make the correct changes).
		You must plan as many related edits together and execute one tool call with all the changes to ensure consistency and avoid conflicts.
		Each SEARCH block must match the existing content exactly, including whitespace and punctuation.
		Each REPLACE block should contain the final, full updated version of that section, without placeholders or incomplete code, it should be the content based on you prior thinking and reasoning.
		You must use multiple SEARCH/REPLACE pairs in the same call if you need to make multiple related changes to the same file, this is the preferred way to make changes to a file instead of calling file_editor tool many times.
		If unsure about what to replace, read the file first using the read_file tool and confirm the exact content, if you are failing to match the content exactly, you should re-read the file content and try again before falling back to whole_write mode.
		You must think out loud before calling file_editor tool this means inside <thinking></thinking> tags, articulate your changeset plan with helpful questions like: What lines are you changing? Why are you changing them? Show a small snippet of the before/after changes if helpful. Confirm that you have all the context and that the SEARCH block matches exactly.
		#### CRITICAL RULES WHEN USING file_editor WITH EDIT MODE. (WHEN USING SEARCH/REPLACE BLOCKS):
		Read the File if Needed: Ensure you have the most recent file content.
		Match Exactly: The SEARCH section must be character-for-character identical to the file's current content, including spacing and indentation.
		No Placeholders: Provide fully updated content in the REPLACE section.
		Multiple Blocks: If you have several related changes, bundle them in one call with multiple SEARCH/REPLACE pairs.
		Context Lines: Include at least 3 lines of context before your target line to ensure a robust match. Add a few lines after as well if possible

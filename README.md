# Welcome to Kodu Coder

<img src="./assets/kodu.png" width="100" align="right" />
Kodu Coder is a coding agent extension tailored for use with Kodu Cloud. We're excited to share our work with the community and invite you to explore the new features and capabilities we've added.

## About Kodu Coder

Kodu Coder is a powerful tool that helps you code faster and more efficiently. It's like having a coding assistant right in your editor! Kodu Coder can help you with a variety of tasks, from writing code to debugging and testing. It's perfect for developers who want to save time and improve their workflow or for beginners who have never coded before.

## Demo
For this demo, let's create a simple hangman game using react, starting with a default create-react-app project. We'll use Kodu Coder to help us write the code for the game.

## How does it work

Kodu Coder leverages the powerfull Claude LLM model from Anthropic in collaboration with Kodu Cloud, to provide a seamless use of the underlying model. The extension allows you to interact with the model through a chat interface, where you can ask questions, run commands, and get help with your code. Kodu Cloud adds the ability to use *tools* to help you code faster and more efficiently. 

### Tools

Kodu Coder has access to the following capabilities:

1. **Execute Command**: Run terminal commands on the system (with user permission)
2. **List Files (Top Level)**: List all paths for files at the top level of a specified directory
3. **List Files (Recursive)**: List all paths for files in a specified directory and nested subdirectories
4. **View Source Code Definitions**: Parse source code files to extract names of key elements like classes and functions
5. **Read File**: Read the contents of a file at a specified path
6. **Write to File**: Write content to a file at a specified path, creating necessary directories
7. **Ask Followup Question**: Gather additional information from the user to complete a task
8. **Attempt Completion**: Present the result to the user after completing a task
9. **Open File**: Open a file in the default application for the file type
10. *More to come...*: Have a suggestion? Let us know by creating an issue or telling us about it in our Discord server!

## Working in Existing Projects
Using the context of the previous demo, let's see how Kodu Coder can help you work in existing projects. In this example, we'll use Kodu Coder to help us implement a confetti animation using the external `react-confetti-explosion` npm package.

As you can see, Kodu Coder was able to add the animation, it can efficiently navigate and understand existing projects by:

1. Analyzing the file structure
2. Examining source code definitions
3. Reading relevant files

This approach allows Kodu Coder to provide valuable assistance even for complex, large-scale projects without overwhelming its context window.
